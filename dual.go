// A DualMap is a map that will store values in a way that allows you to
// access them by either key. For any key tuple (K1, K2), you can get the
// set of all values by either K1 or K2. This contrasts with a standard
// multilevel map, which provides no querying capability with just the
// second level of a key (other than scanning the whole thing).
//
// The full key (P, S) must be unique, but there can be any number of
// "primaries" associated with a given "secondary key" and vice versa.
//
// I have found it convenient to remember the map as having one of the
// particular types as "primary", so this map refers to the "Primary"
// mapping and the "Reverse" mapping. This helps keep straight which keys
// are which, even in situations where you have no particular
// preference. If you have no preference, it doesn't actually matter;
// DualMap entire point is to be fully symmetric on the types.
//
// The zero-value of this struct is safe to use. When Set is first used,
// the maps will be initialized.
//
// Direct read access is permissible. You should not directly write to the
// maps. DualMap makes no guarantees if you directly write to the internal
// maps.
